# System-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
Our client was DrivePass and we designed a system for their business which involved practicing with student drivers getting them ready for their driver test. This system involved a PC (for reception), a cloud server (for their website), a website, and human actors.

What did you do particularly well?
I think I did well with realizing that this is a system that wasn't solely based on a computer. It was partially digital and partially real world.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would probably add more to the diagrams and charts I made to make them more in depth.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I thought about use case scenarios and the steps each user would have to go through to accomplish certain actions. It's important to consider a user's needs because they are the ones who will actually be using the system. I think when the focus is all about what you have in mind for a system and how you plan to use, which are all valid ideas, you don't stop and think about how someone else will use and interact with a system.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Incrementally and iteratively. I like the technique of planning a system out with UML diagrams. It really helps you picture a system and the activity flows within. It helps you think about what logic will be needed for each use case as well as potential errors.
